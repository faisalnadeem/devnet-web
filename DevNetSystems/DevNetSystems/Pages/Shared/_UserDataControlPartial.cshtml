                        As the parent company behind several apps and digital services, we take your privacy and data rights seriously. While each of our applications operates independently, they all follow the same core principle: your data belongs to you.

                        We empower all users with full control over their personal information. If at any point you want your data updated, reviewed, or permanently deleted from any of our apps or partner services, you can submit a request—and we will process it promptly and securely.
                        Your choice is our responsibility, and your privacy is our priority.
